MARINE PEST DISTRIBUTIONS IN AN AQUACULTURE SEASCAPE

Atalah J, Fletcher LM, Davidson I, South PM, Forrest, BM

ABSTRACT
The global proliferation of marine artificial habitats is altering the physical structure of coastlines at a fast pace, with knock on effects on physical, chemical, and ecological processes at seascape scales. However, the ecological consequences of the introduction of maritime sprawl associated with aquaculture is less understood, despite that floating farms are particularly prone to issues from biofouling. We characterised spatial and temporal distributional patterns of ten algal and invertebrate biofouling taxa in relation to the presence and distance to mussel farms in New Zealand’s largest aquaculture region. Field surveys were conducted on farm structures and in adjacent and distant natural rocky habitats. Seven out of ten taxa had significantly higher cover on farms compared to natural habitats through the region. Some biofouling taxa (e.g. the ascidian Ciona robusta) were absent from natural habitats, whereas others (e.g. Didemnum vexillum) were limited to erected biogenic structures that provide refuge from predation. Of particular interest were ‘blooms’ of several opportunistic macroalgal species, such as Cladophora ruchengeri and Pylaella littoralis, which have the ability of colonising extensive areas of natural habitat. Furthermore, the cover of four taxa significantly decayed with increasing distance to the nearest farm, suggesting that mussel farms may act as reservoir and/or ‘stepping-stones’ for the dispersal of marine pests. These distributional and dispersal patterns to informed integrated pest management efforts focusing on the establishment ‘firebreaks’ in farm connectivity, avoidance of pest hotspots and farm fallowing.
